Send Passwords to GSuite Users via Spreadsheet

Use this script to mail merge via Google Sheets.  In my use case this is to be used in Google Deployments when sending unique passwords to new users.  This alleviates the need to use a 3rd party application or use Excel.  

Steps:

1.  Create sheet with relevant headers
2.  Click Tools > Script Editor
3.  Copy/Paste the script and click "Save"
4.  Test with 1 or 2 users - (Click Run)
5.  After verifying test, create all data within the sheet
6.  Click Run in the script
